    <p>Python is an object-oriented, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. The language's name comes not from the animal, but from the comedian Monty Python. Python is a language very well known because of its power and its very simple syntax. Python is a commonly recommended language for beginners, as it takes away many difficulties of other languages, and still includes many of the features of other languages.</p>
    <p>Python is widely used in many products and services, such as <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/web-service-efficiency-at-instagram-with-python-4976d078e366">Instragram's backend</a> code built with the Django framework, which is entirely written in Python. For numerical calculus applications, there are powerful and very efficient libraries available such as NumPy. Recently, Python's popularity has increased tremendously because of its use in the Data Science and Machine learning fields. Python then has something for everyone, and its syntax makes it very easy to create prototypes, ship products and new features, or simply play around with programming.

    <p>
      If you're using a Mac or a PC, Python installers can be downloaded from the official website. Beginners should use Python 3+ versions, as Python 2 versions are no longer supported. Although widely used, many projects are switching or have switched, so there's not a lot of reasons why one should learn Python 2 first.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're using Linux you probably already have Python installed. You can check whether you have or not by using python3 -v on the console, this command should tell you which version of Python you have. If not, you can use your Linux distro package manager.
    </p>
    <p>If you're planning on using Python for data science applications, you might want to look into the Anaconda distribution of Python. Basically, it is like a regular installation with many science-oriented Python packages included. It can save you time, but if you're unsure, it might be better to go with the regular install and add later the packages you need.</p>

    <p>
      Once you have Python installed, you can launch the Integrated Development and Learning Environment, or IDLE. In the interactive window, you should see a >>> prompt.
      In the interactive prompt you can enter simple python expressions and see the result. For example, you could add numbers with the sum operator. Entering 2+2 would look like:</p>
    <code class="console">
      >>> 2 + 2
      4
      >>>
    </code>
    <p>
      Expressions like this and many others can be defined as a basic instruction in Python. You can also do other operations:
    </p>

    <code class="console">>>> 2 - 2
      0
      >>> 2 * 3
      6
      >>> 5 / 2
      2.5
      >>> 5 // 2
      2
      >>> 3 ** 3
      9
    </code>
    <p>
      Which are substractions, multiplications, division, integer division and exponentiation, respectively.
    </p>

    <p>As we have shown, Python can do simple operations on different values. And more generally, Python gives you a way of manipulating data. In many programming languages, data is classified by types, which usually determines how it can be handled and interact with other data. We have introduced two different data types: integer number (or int) and floating-point number (or float). Another simple data type is string or str, and simply refers to text values. Other, more complicated data types will be introduced later.</p>

    <p>
      Usually, Python programs are run in scripts instead of the IDLE. A Python script is basically a text file with a .py extension. You call this scripts by calling it in the console as <code></code>

    <header>Flow control and Logic</header>
    <p>
      Flow control structures allow the programmer to decide whether a certain part of the code executes or not, and on what conditions will this happen. The first one we'll go through is the if-else . It's basic structure is
    </p>
    <code class="console">if condition:
      # code that will execute if the condition is true
      else:
      # code that will execute if condition is false
    </code>
    <p>
      An example of this is the following code
    </p>
    <code class="console">a = 5
      b = 8
      if a > b:
      <span class="ident"></span>print(f'{a} is greater than {b}')
      else:
      <span class="ident"></span>print(f'{a} is greater than {b}')
    </code>
